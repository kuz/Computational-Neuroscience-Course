The file epilepsy.zip contains 16 ASCII files of measurements on a human
patient with epilepsy.  These are electrocorticogram (ECoG) data, in the 
form of time series at each of 76 electrodes.  Sixty-four of these 
electrodes were in the form of an 8x8 grid at the cortical level, while
the other 12 were in the form of two six-electrode strips that were 
implanted deeper in the brain.  (See Figs. 4.10 and 4.11 of the book.)

Eight sets of measurements were taken on this patient, corresponding to 
eight different epileptic seizures.  An epileptologist, examining the 
data for each seizure, identified two key periods relating to the seizure
i.e., the so-called pre-ictal and ictal periods, and time series data 
for those periods were extracted.  For each of the eight seizures, there 
are two files, one for pre-ictal (labeled 'pre') and the other for ictal 
(labeled 'ict').  Each file is 4000 X 76 (i.e., 4000 time points by 76 
electrodes).  The sampling rate is 400 Hz, so each file contains 10 
seconds of data recorded at the 76 electrodes.
